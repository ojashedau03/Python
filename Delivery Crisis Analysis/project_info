Problem Statement
QuickBite Express is a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup (founded in 2020) that connects customers with nearby restaurants and cloud kitchens.

In June 2025, QuickBite faced a major crisis. A viral social media incident involving food safety violations at partner restaurants, 
combined with a week-long delivery outage during the monsoon season, triggered massive customer backlash. 
Competitors capitalized with aggressive campaigns, worsening the situation.

The challenges were severe: 
A large portion of active users disengaged within a short period. 
Daily orders saw a sharp decline compared to earlier months. 
Customer satisfaction scores fell sharply, signaling trust issues. 
Many partner restaurants shifted to competing platforms. 
Customer acquisition costs rose significantly. 
QuickBite has allocated a major recovery budget, overhauled food safety protocols, and upgraded its delivery infrastructure.
